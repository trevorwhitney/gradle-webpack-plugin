# Gradle Webpack Plugin

A plugin for building frontend assets with webpack and gradle.
The main goal of this plugin is to make javascript a first class citizen in a gradle build.
In addition to providing tasks for buildling and testing javascript, this plugin aims to make
gradle aware of javascript inputs and outputs so it can make intelligent decisions about which
tasks need to be run, just as it does for JVM languages.

This plugin is currently a work in progress.
